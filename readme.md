InteractiveSolutions\PushNotification
====================================

The goal of this module is to provide a easy way to send push notifications using background tasks via 
[ZfBernard](https://github.com/interactive-solutions/zf-bernard) as well providing a rest api for 
associating users with their devices, simplifying push notifications for zend framework projects. 


# Dependencies

A bit about the dependencies of this module and why we use them

* ZfBernard - Used for sending the notification in the background
* Zfc-Commons/Zfc-Rbac - Used for the authorization of the user device api
* ZendFramework/ZendService-(apple|google) - Kinda obvious

# Installation

Installation is of course done via our best friend composer

`composer require interactive-solutions/zf-push-notification`

# Configuration
